- Individual Planet Speed Control: Adjust the orbital speed of each planet independently using dedicated sliders, allowing for focused observation and experimentation.
- Animation Pause/Resume: A convenient button to pause and resume the entire solar system animation, perfect for detailed examination or taking a break.
- Responsive Design: The simulation adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on various devices.
- Starry Background: A immersive starry background enhances the visual appeal of the cosmic environment.
- Planet Rotation: Each planet also rotates on its own axis, adding to the realism.
- Saturn and Uranus Rings: Visually represented rings for Saturn and Uranus.
- Planet Orbit Paths: Subtle lines visually indicate the orbital paths of each planet.

## Technologies
- Vite: A fast and opinionated build tool for modern web projects, used for rapid development and bundling.
- Three.js: A powerful 3D JavaScript library used to create and display the 3D solar system, planets, and their movements.
- HTML5: For structuring the web page and control panel.
- CSS3: For styling the user interface and ensuring a visually appealing layout.
- JavaScript (ES6+): The core programming language for implementing the simulation logic and interactivity.
